Technologically it is working as "Philips Ambilight" ( or aims to work :) ) 

Goal of this repository is to provide you with all you may need for this project to run. 


## Running the application
The ocmplete solution requires several components:
* LED strip of WS2812B ( at least 4 LEDs ) 
* Electronic controller to driver the LEDs ( AVR/STM or any other microcontroller/device capable of this )
* Above device needs to support RS232-USB 
* Client needs to install runtime environment https://slimdx.org/download.php ( TODO - document better )

Below you may find video from initial release. Its made with low quality cam so will require updating for sure.
